# GraphvizAnim

GraphvizAnim is a tool to create simple animated graph visualizations; it is
just a proof of concept, aimed mainly to teaching purposes. It is based on
[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) for the graph rendering part and on
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) for the animated gif generation.

A *graph animation* is just a sequence of *steps*, a step is in turn one or
more *actions* such as: *add*, *hilight*, or *remove* a *node*, or an *edge*.
Animations can be built by invoking suitable methods of a `gvanim.Animation`
object (in a Python program), or by parsing a simple text file (that, in turn,
can be generated by a program in any language).

The [examples](examples) folder contains few instances of such approaches. You
can generate an animated depth first visit (in a 3-regular random graph of 6
nodes) by running

	export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
	python examples/dfv.py

or you can generate the simple animation described in
[simple.txt](examples/simple.txt) as

	export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
	python -m gvanim simple < examples/simple.txt

finally, you can generate an [Erdős–Rényi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C
5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model) graph (with 10 nodes and edge probability
1/10) by running

	export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
	cd examples
	gcc -o er er.c
	./er | python -m gvanim er

## Todo

Any help will be appreciated. Things to do to make this more usable are:

- [ ] add other *actions* (such as labeling of nodes and edges),
- [ ] document the Python code,
- [ ] add option parsing to `__main__.py`,
- [ ] integrate this with [PyGraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/),
- [ ] integrate this with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/),
- [ ] add more relavant examples.
